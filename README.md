# Link_Rate_Measurement_Tool
 A tool developed as part of the TUM Multimedia Communication course to measure the link rate of a data streaming service (see Link Rate Measurement Tool) and to download an audio file from a TUM server.

 Unfortunately the server is no longer reachable (Maybe IP changed or discontinued making the program useless). The connection remains inactive and no proper time out exceptions were implemented by me back then so that when requesting data it causes the program to freeze when trying to communicate with the server.
